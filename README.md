CacheIO
=============

CacheIO is a library to persist objects easier and define different caching strategies to be sure that you know when your information need to be updated.

Usage
-----

Create an instance of CacheIO. This is class configure the cache system.

```java
CacheIO cacheIO = CacheIO.with(getApplicationContext())
    .addLogging(true)
    .addDbName("cache.http")
    .addGson(GsonFactory.create())
    .build();
```

Now you can to get the CacheDataSource object that contains all the methods to persist and obtains your objects.

```java
CacheDataSource cacheDataSource = cacheIO.cacheDataSource();
```

Save a object:

```java
User userOne = new User();
userOne.setId(1);
userOne.setName("Jose Luis Franconetti");

// Create a cache entry object to save the User.
CacheEntry cacheEntryUserOne = CacheEntry.create("user.key.one" /*Key*/, User.class /*Type*/, userOne /*data*/);

cacheDataSource.persist(cacheEntryUserOne);
```

Obtain object:
```java
CacheEntry resultQueryUserOne = cacheDataSource.obtain("user.key.one");

User resultUser = (User) resultQueryUserOne.getValue();
```

See test cases in `src/test/` for more examples
